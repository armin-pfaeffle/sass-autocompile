# sass-autocompile package

Automatically compiles SASS files on save.

---

Inspired by and based on [less-autocompile](https://atom.io/packages/less-autocompile) package, written by [lohek](https://atom.io/users/lohek), I have created a counterpart for [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). This package automatically compiles your SASS file (file ending: `.scss` or `.sass`) when you save it.



## Requirements

At the moment, you can only use this package when you install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) on you system. It's important that you install node-sass globally (command: `npm install node-sass -g`), so it's possible to access it via CLI.

The reason why *sass-autocompile* needs that is because node-sass is not compatible with atom shell in the current version (2.0.1), so it cannot be added as dependency. Probably that will change later, so you won't have to install node.js and node-sass additionally ‒ I put it to the roadmap.



## Usage

**Important:** *Install node.js and node-sass before, see [requirements](#requirements).*

Basically you enable auto-compile on save in two steps:

1. Add `.scss` or `.sass` as file extension to your SASS file
2. Add at least `// out: ../css/main.css` to the **first line** of your SASS file ‒ please modifiy the relative path and the css filename

To enable advanced features have a look at the complete list of [parameters](#parameters). The [examples](#examples) give you a short demonstration about using them.

Beside the parameters you can set [plugin options](#options) which are used as general options for auto-compiling. **Important**: since version 0.5 parameters in SASS files override the general options ‒ so you can set 'Output Style: Compressed' in options, but disable this feature for a special project by setting `outputStyle: nested` in your SASS file parameters.

After saving a SASS file, you should see a notification or a panel at the bottom of the editor, depending on your settings, showing you an error or success message. If you use *panel notification* ([see options](#options) -> `Notifications`) , you have the possibility to access the output CSS file by clicking on the compilation message. If compiliation fails, you can even jump to error position in the corresponding SASS file where error occured.

When using panel notification you can use **Show detailed output** link in the header caption of the panel to open detailed output of `node-sass` command (available since 0.7.0). Additionally you can set option [Show node-sass output after compilation](#show-node-sass-output-after-compilation) to automatically show output after compilation.


### Parameters

Add following parameters in *comma-separated* way to the **first line** of your SASS file (file extension: `.scss` or `.sass`). See [examples](#examples) for demonstration, especially for `main` parameter:
```js
// path of target CSS file
out: main.css

// if true CSS file is compressed
outputStyle: nested | compact | expanded | compressed

// Indention type: space or tab, default: space
indentType: space | tab

// Indention width, maximum: 10, default: 2
indentWidth: 0-10

// Linefeed: 'cr', 'crlf', 'lf', 'lfcr'
linefeed: cr | crlf | lf | lfcr

// path to your main SASS file to be compiled
// see http://sass-guidelin.es/#main-file
main: ../main-scss.scss

// creates source map file if a filename is given or if true source map filename
// is automatically set as css filename extended with ".map" [*]
sourceMap: true | false | <filename>.css.map

// if true source map is embedded as data URI [*]
sourceMapEmbed: true | false

// if true the contents are included to the source map information [*]
sourceMapContents: true | false

// if true additional debugging information is added to the output file as CSS
// comments, but only if CSS is not compressed [*]
sourceComments: true | false

// path to look for imported files [*]
includePath: ../my-framework/scss/

// The amount of precision allowed in decimal numbers, default: 5
precision: <number>

// Path to .js file containing custom importer
importer: <filename.js>

// Path to .js file containing custom functions
functions: <filename.js>
```

 (*) For further information have a look at the [node-sass documentation](https://github.com/sass/node-sass).

 The old parameter `compress: true / false` is still supported, although you should use `outputStyle` parameter. If you set `compress: true` output style will be set to `Compressed`. If you set `compress: false` output style is set to `Nested`.


### Examples

When you add the `out` parameter your SASS file is compiled to `main.css` in the relative path `../css/`.
```
// out: ../css/main.css
```

To additionally compress the output you have to add `outputStyle: compressed` or set option *Output Style*:
```
// out: ../css/main.css, outputStyle: compressed
```

If you use `@import` command in SASS, you should define the `main` parameter in the *child files*. Imagine you have the following structure:
```
main.scss       // main file which imports colors and layout files
colors.scss     // contains color definitions
layout.scss     // contains layout definitions
```

Add the following comment to `main.scss` to enabled auto compilation on save.
```
// out: ../css/main.css, outputStyle: compressed
```

... and add this to `colors.scss` and `layout.scss` to enable auto compilation on saving each of this two *child files*.
```
// main: main.scss
```
The special about this parameter is, that when you save a child file, the `main.scss` is compiled, not the child file itself. So you can structure your SASS files, modify them and after saving, everything is compiled correctly, not only the saved file.



## Options

#### Enabled
You can use this option to disable auto compiling SASS file on save. This is especially useful when you migrate from CSS or LESS to SASS, having some errors in the SASS files and don't want to see a error message on each save.  
**Shortcut for toggling auto-compile**: `ctrl-alt-shift-s` / `ctrl-cmd-shift-s`  
*__Default__: true*


#### Output Style
With this option you can decide which output style you want to use. You have four options:
- Nested
- Compact
- Expanded
- Compressed

*__Default__: Compressed*


#### Indent type
With this option you can set the indention type: space or tab.  
*__Default__: space*


#### Indent width
This option defines the number of spaces or tabs to be used for indention.  
*__Default__: 2*


#### Linefeed
Used to determine whether to use `cr`, `crlf`, `lf` or `lfcr` sequence for line break.  
*__Default__: lf*


#### Precision
Used to determine how many digits after the decimal will be allowed. For instance, if you had a decimal number of 1.23456789 and a precision of 5, the result will be 1.23457 in the final CSS.  
*__Default__: 5*


#### Filename to custom importer
If you want to use a custom import functionality, you can use this option to define a path to a JavaScript file that contains your code.  
*__Default__: ''*


#### Filename to custom functions
If you have custom functions you want to include, you use this option to set a path to your corresponding JavaScript file.  
*__Default__: ''*


#### Build source map
If enabled a [source map](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/) is generated. Filename is automatically obtained by taking the output CSS filename and appending `.map`, e.g. `output.css.map`.  
*__Default__: false*


#### Embed source map
If enabled source map (see option [Build source map](#build-source-map)) is embedded as a data URI.  
*__Default__: false*


#### Include contents in source map information
If enabled contents are included in source map information.  
*__Default__: false*


#### Include additional debugging information in the output CSS file
If enabled additional debugging information are added to the output file as CSS comments. If CSS is compressed this feature is disabled by SASS compiler.  
*__Default__: false*


#### Include path
Path to look for imported files (`@import` declarations).  
*__Default__: ''*


#### Notifications
This options allows you to decide which feedback you want to see when SASS files are compiled: notification and/or panel.  
**Panel**: The panel is shown at the bottom of the editor. When starting the compilation it's only a small header with a throbber. After compiliation a success or error message is shown with reference to the CSS file, or on error the SASS file. By clicking on the message you can access the CSS or error file.  
**Notification**: The default atom notifications are used for output.  
*__Default__: Panel*


#### Automatically hide panel on ...
Select on which event the panel should automatically disappear. If you want to hide the panel via shortcut, you can use `ctrl-alt-shift-h` / `ctrl-cmd-shift-h`.  
*__Default__: Success*


#### Panel-auto-hide delay
Delay after which panel is automatically hidden.  
*__Default__: 3000*


#### Automatically hide notifications on ...
Decide when you want the notifications to automatically hide. Else you have to close every notification manually.  
*__Default__: Info, Success*


#### Show 'Start Compiling' Notification
If enabled and you added the notification option in `Notifications`, you will see an info-message when compile process starts.  
*__Default__: false*


#### Show node-sass output after compilation
If enabled detailed output of node-sass command is automatically shown in a new tab after each compilation. So you can analyse the output, especially when using [@debug](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#_5), [@warn](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#_6) or [@error](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#_7) in your SASS.  
*__Default__: false*


#### Path to 'node-sass' command
This option is especially for Mac OS and Linux systems like Ubuntu. If *sass-autocompile* can not find `node-sass` command you can set this path to where `node-sass` command is placed, so the absolute path can be used. Only use this option when Atom throws the error "command not found".  
*__Default__: '/usr/local/bin'*



## Predefined shortcuts

#### `ctrl-alt-shift-s` / `ctrl-cmd-shift-s`

Toggles the *sass-autocompile* functionality. If auto-compile functionality is en-/disabled a notification is shown.


#### `ctrl-alt-shift-h` / `ctrl-cmd-shift-h`

Hides the panel if visible.
